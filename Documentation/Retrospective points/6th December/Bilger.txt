Good points:
1. We had the team building event.
2. We had some nice pair programming.
3. Thanks everyone for providing information for the "Hand-in" document.
4. Good demo.
5. Erik is happy.

Points to improve:
1. More pair programming.

3. Not much demoable stuff?
4. Not working docker on my env...
