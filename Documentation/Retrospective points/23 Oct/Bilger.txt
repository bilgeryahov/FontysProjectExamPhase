Goods:
  ->  We learnt a lot from every aspect (managing difficulties, working remotely...)
  -> We had vacation yeeeeeeeeey
  -> The teacher said that it was okay to change the Project Plan

Points to improve:
  -> Don't overwork
  -> If you cannot work on something (any reason) let the team know as soon as you can
  -> We finished the work on time (Because someone did not sleep -> too bad)
