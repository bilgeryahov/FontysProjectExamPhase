Goods:
1) Good job Coen with the CI,
2) Well done to Nikola with setting up the React project,
3) Qyute nice progress, even though we didn't burn ourselves from work,
4) Nice planning and workflow

To be improved:
1) We did not think about the project plan,
2) We forgot to discuss risk analysis,
3) We might think about supporting each other while having a discussion with client/teacher
